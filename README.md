### Project Description: Scalable Chat Application

#### Project Overview:
The Scalable Chat Application is a highly responsive and scalable real-time chat platform designed to support seamless communication across multiple servers. By leveraging modern technologies such as TurboRepo, Redis, Kafka, and PostgreSQL, the application ensures efficient message handling, data persistence, and user connectivity across a distributed environment. The main objective is to scale the Socket.IO server infrastructure, allowing users connected to different servers to interact as if they were on a single server.

#### Key Components:

1. **TurboRepo**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages multiple projects within a monorepo architecture.
   - **Role**: Facilitates streamlined development, testing, and deployment processes across various microservices and components of the chat application.

2. **Redis Server**:
   - **Purpose**: Acts as a high-performance, in-memory data store.
   - **Role**: 
     - Stores messages from multiple users.
     - Manages real-time message broadcasting to all connected users, regardless of the server they are connected to.
     - Provides low-latency data access and pub/sub capabilities to ensure real-time message delivery.

3. **Kafka**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides a robust and scalable streaming platform.
   - **Role**: 
     - Handles the ingestion of message data streams.
     - Ensures reliable and fault-tolerant data processing and integration with downstream services.
     - Buffers and streams data to the PostgreSQL database for long-term storage and analytics.

4. **PostgreSQL**:
   - **Purpose**: Serves as the relational database for persistent storage.
   - **Role**: 
     - Stores chat history, user data, and metadata.
     - Supports complex queries and data retrieval operations to provide a comprehensive chat history and analytics.

5. **Socket.IO**:
   - **Purpose**: Enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication.
   - **Role**: 
     - Manages user connections and disconnections.
     - Facilitates real-time messaging between users.
     - Works in conjunction with Redis to synchronize messages across multiple servers.

#### Scalability Strategy:
The core challenge addressed by this project is the scaling of Socket.IO servers to ensure consistent and reliable communication between users connected to different server instances. The architecture achieves this through:

1. **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming connections across multiple Socket.IO server instances to balance the load and optimize resource utilization.
2. **Redis Pub/Sub**: Utilizes Redisâ€™s pub/sub feature to broadcast messages to all connected clients across different servers, ensuring real-time message delivery.
3. **Kafka Streaming**: Integrates Kafka to manage the high-throughput message streams, decoupling the message production and consumption processes to enhance scalability.
4. **Horizontal Scaling**: Adds more server instances as the user base grows, maintaining performance and reliability.

#### Implementation Plan:
1. **Setup TurboRepo**:
   - Organize the codebase into a monorepo.
   - Define project boundaries and dependencies.

2. **Configure Redis**:
   - Set up Redis clusters for scalability and reliability.
   - Implement pub/sub logic for real-time message broadcasting.

3. **Integrate Kafka**:
   - Set up Kafka brokers and topics.
   - Develop producers and consumers for message streaming.

4. **Design PostgreSQL Schema**:
   - Create tables for storing chat data and user information.
   - Optimize the schema for read and write performance.

5. **Develop Socket.IO Server**:
   - Implement connection handling and messaging logic.
   - Integrate with Redis for cross-server communication.

6. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure system reliability and performance.
   - Deploy the application using a CI/CD pipeline.

#### Expected Outcomes:
- A robust, scalable chat application that supports real-time messaging across multiple servers.
- Seamless user experience with minimal latency and high reliability.
- Scalable infrastructure capable of handling a growing user base without degradation in performance.

This Scalable Chat Application project not only addresses the immediate need for efficient real-time communication but also lays a solid foundation for future enhancements and scalability.

# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
